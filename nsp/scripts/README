        README FOR THE REGRESSION TESTS
        -------------------------------


Several scripts are available to carry out the regression test
procedure :

    - regression-test.sci : it generates the test files used as
      references

    - regression_status.pl : it finds all the test files in the
      directory ../test and compute the price saved in the file with
      the newly comuted one. If both are equal up to a given precision
      EPS, then the test is considered to be passed.  It creates a
      file named after "diff-xxxx.txt" where "xxxx" is the date and
      time of the test containing for the routines that have not
      passed the test the absolute values of the differences between
      the old and new runs for every numerical entries in the
      return. These files are never deleted.


      When called with the option --update, it updated Premia and
      recompile it before going through the tst files.

    - compare_eps.sci : it compares the numerical entries contained in
      two lists with a precision of EPS. The non numerical fields are
      simply ignored. The difference with the previous run of test is
      written into a file named "diff-xxxx.txt" where "xxxx" is the
      date and time of the test.
