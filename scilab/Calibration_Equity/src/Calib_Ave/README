The source files of the calibration code are in the subdirectory:
 ./src

To compile the two programs calib_Avellaneda and pricer_Avellaneda:

 cd ./src
 make or make all
or you can compile each program separately:
 make calib_Avellaneda
 make pricer_Avellaneda

To execute a program, e.g. calib_Avellaneda,
you have to edit a file ended by .in, calib_Avellaneda.in in this case.
You can find examples of files calib_Avellaneda.in in the subdirectory ./src.
The file pricer_Avellaneda.in is automatically created by calib_Avellaneda.
See the documentation ./doc/documentation.ps for the detailed description
of those input files.

The subdirectory ./doc contains the documentation of the code
containing more details concerning the execution of each programs.
See the file ./doc/documentation.ps.
