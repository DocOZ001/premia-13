The source files of the calibration code are in the subdirectory:
 ./src

To compile the five programs simul, calib, rafsig, visusig and 
impsig:
 cd ./src
 make or make all
or you can compile each program separately:
 make simul
 make calib
etc.

You can execute each program from other test subdirectories 
(e.g. by creating ./tests). Make sure that the subdirectory 
./src containing the programs (after compilation) is in 
your Unix environment variable PATH.

To execute a program, e.g. calib, from a test subdirectory, 
you have to edit a file ended by .in, calib.in in this case. 
You can find examples of files simul.in, calib.in, etc. 
in the subdirectory ./src/examples.

The subdirectory ./src/matlab contains useful programs 
to visualize the results with Matlab. For instance, 
vprice.m (type help vprice in Matlab to have the documentation) 
allows us the visualize option prices or volatilities 
(files ended by .visu in the given examples).

The scripts Perl decroi1 and decroi2 contained in ./src/scripts 
are useful to extract the decrease of the cost function from 
a file containing the output of a calib execution. Use decroi1 
if the output is given by the Quasi-Newton algorithm without 
constraints and decroi2 if the output is given by the Quasi-Newton 
algorithm with bounds.

The subdirectory ./doc contains the documentation of the code 
containing more details concerning the execution of each programs. 
See the file ./doc/documentation_code.ps.
