1) Using calibration with scilab
________________________________


If you  want to use the calibration module with scilab, simply run
the file interface.sci located in the root of calibration tree.

Select the method, then the parameters.

For more help about parameters see the hep of each routine.


2) Separately

Go to the src repertory and then go to the repertory of the method
you want. Except for Markov which is only implemented with scilab,
you have a Makefile which allow you to copile and run each
program.

For Linux Interface execute

exec builder.sce;

in all /src subdirectory
