The program directory contains the following files:

- a binary executable file "Calibration_levy" generated by the compilation

- an example of input market data:  Data/MarketData.dat,

- make files : Makefile Makeuser.incl


Compilation 
===========

Compilation command under Linux: use the command make
This generates the executable binary file "Calibration_levy". 


Execution
=========

Type ./Calibration_levy to run the calibration program. 

You can choose either to calibrate on levy (type model 0 ) or stochastic volatility model (type model 1 ).


Output of results
=================

We print the value of parameters and error function at every step of the optimization algorithm.

At the end, we print the output parameters, the error function value and the volatility table.

Output data are stored in Data/ModelData.dat

Gnuplot script can be running to generate eps files with price surface and volatility surface.
