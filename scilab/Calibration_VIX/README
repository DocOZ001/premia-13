**The calibration toolbox for equity using VIX in the Revisited Bergomi model**


The program directory the following files:

- source files : calibVixSmiles.c

- a binary executable file "Calibration_VIX" generated by the compilation

- an example of input market data: VIXDATA.txt

- make files : Makefile Makeuser.incl


The file VIXDATA.tex contains the market prices (undiscounted) of VIX
futures and options as follows
for each maturity T, we give the IntialVariance (VS) with maturity T, 
VIX future price with maturity T, a Put on VIX, P1,  with strike K1 
and a Put on VIX, P2, with strike K2 and maturity T.

Line 1 : T \t VS \t F \t K1 \t  P1 \t  K2 \t P2

Line 2 contains the number of maturities

From line 3, we put
100 * T \t   100 * VS \t  100 * F \t  100 * K1 \t  100 * P1 \t  100 * K2 \t  100 * P2

Compilation 
===========

Compilation command under Linux: use the command make
This generates the executable binary file "Calibration_VIX". 

Execution
=========

Type ./Calibration_VIX to run the calibration program.
