Compilation
===========

In this directory to build the library just type 

    make

It is independent of the other files of Premia;

It will compile the following algorithms

1) Closed Formula for Caplet Pricing in LMM-CEV
2) Monte Carlo algortihm for Caplet Pricing  LMM-CEV

Once you have installed Premia, in order to run the
pricer, you must execute, within a scilab window,
the script compile.sci through the command
exec("lmm_cev.sci",-1)
This script cleans up the directory from old object files/libraries, 
builds up the shared library, loads it, and  finally runs the pricer.
